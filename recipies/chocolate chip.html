     <h2>Crispy and sweet</h2> 
             
          <p>  <Strong>The perfect chocolate chip cookie is made with butter</Strong>.
               That gives it that unique and very special buttery 
              flavor, and delightful crispy texture when you take your first bite. 
              For me, its all about hte first bite.
